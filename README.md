# CS 230 – Software Design Portfolio

## The Gaming Room Client Overview
The client for this project was The Gaming Room, a company that developed a game called *Draw It or Lose It*. The client wanted to expand their existing game into a distributed, multi-platform software application that could run reliably across different operating systems. The primary goal was to design a scalable and efficient system architecture that supported multiple users while maintaining performance, security, and reliability.

## What I Did Well
One area I performed particularly well in was analyzing the client’s requirements and translating them into a clear and structured software design document. I effectively compared operating platforms, evaluated system architectures, and justified design decisions based on performance, memory management, and scalability considerations.

## Design Documentation and Code Development
Working through the design document before coding helped clarify system requirements and architectural decisions early in the development process. This made it easier to understand how different components of the system should interact and reduced potential issues during implementation by identifying constraints and design considerations ahead of time.

## Areas for Improvement
If I were to revise one part of my work, I would expand the technical depth of the architecture discussion by including more detailed diagrams and additional analysis of alternative design approaches. This would further strengthen the justification for the final design decisions.

## Interpreting User Needs
User needs were interpreted by analyzing the client’s goals for scalability, performance, and multi-platform compatibility. These needs were implemented through design choices such as distributed system architecture, efficient memory usage, and platform-agnostic development considerations. Considering user needs is critical because it ensures the final system meets business goals and provides a reliable user experience.

## Software Design Approach
My approach to software design involves understanding the problem domain, identifying system constraints, and evaluating multiple architectural options before selecting the most appropriate solution. In future projects, I will continue using structured analysis, comparison of alternatives, and iterative refinement to design scalable and maintainable software systems.
